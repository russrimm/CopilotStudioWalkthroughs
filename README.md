## Overview

This document provides step-by-step instructions for creating a Microsoft Copilot Studio agent that addresses a critical identity and access management challenge: helping users who are locked out of their accounts due to Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) issues, particularly after getting a new device. 

### Use Cases
- Employees who have replaced their mobile device and cannot access their authenticator app
- Remote workers who need immediate access outside of IT support hours
- Users experiencing technical issues with their existing authentication methods
- Onboarding scenarios where temporary access is needed before permanent credentials are established

### Benefits
- Reduces helpdesk call volume by providing self-service password reset capabilities
- Minimizes productivity loss due to account lockouts
- Decreases IT support costs while maintaining strong security controls
- Provides 24/7 access recovery without requiring IT staff intervention
- Creates an auditable trail of access recovery attempts

### Security Considerations
The solution incorporates several critical security measures:

1. **User Verification**: Before issuing a Temporary Access Pass, the agent conducts a thorough identity verification process using information that only the legitimate user should know. This multi-question approach significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access.

2. **Limited Lifetime**: The Temporary Access Pass is configured with a short lifetime (10 minutes) and set as single-use only, minimizing the window of opportunity for potential misuse.

3. **Secure Credential Storage**: As a security best practice, the solution stores client IDs, tenant IDs, and secret keys in Azure Key Vault rather than embedding them directly in the flows. For proof-of-concept environments, these can optionally be stored in environment variables, though this is not recommended for production deployments.

### How the Agent Works
The agent operates through a conversational interface that follows a strict verification workflow:

1. The user initiates the conversation with the trigger phrase "Reset my Password"
2. The agent requests the user's employee number to identify them in the system
3. Upon finding a match, the agent begins the verification process by asking a series of security questions
4. If the user answers ANY question incorrectly, the agent immediately terminates the conversation with a generic message, preventing attackers from learning which specific answer was incorrect
5. Only after correctly answering ALL verification questions will the agent issue a Temporary Access Pass
6. The pass is displayed to the user along with its expiration time

The solution is highly customizable, allowing for:
- Any number of verification questions to balance security with user experience
- Optional integration with ticketing systems to automatically create and close support tickets for audit purposes
- Customization of messages and verification logic to suit organizational policies
```
